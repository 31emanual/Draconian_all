# Draconian_all
All draconian 2D files
Important- This is to be used by Unity 3D. Make a seperate folder named "Draconian 2D" and also create a github folder using the desktop app. Move the game folder into the github folder and you're set.
You could also create the unity project inside the github folder after you create it...
